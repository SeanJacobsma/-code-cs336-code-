My idea for my web app is a homework planner. Most todo lists have a system set up to allow
the addition of an item to the list, and a function to remove the item when it is done.
However, when I do my homework I mark when the assignment is due, when I plan to work on it,
and when I plan to finish it. This is a feature that most todo lists do not even think of
as an option. These assignments could then be displayed on a weekly or monthly chart.
