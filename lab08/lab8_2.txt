A:
  I:
    The component structure breaks the application into several different
    segments, that form the whole application. UI is composable if the
    components work together to make a cohesive application. this is
    important, because it allows a more fluid user experience.
  II:
    JSX helps react to work well by adding XML syntax into JavaScript.
  III:
    ReactJS is safe from XSS in that when it pulls in HTML it converts the
    divisions into a string so it cannot be added as raw HTML
  IV:
    data flows from parent to child. comments are loaded by setting the state
    to be the comment. If you want to create a new comment you change the state
    to the value of the new comment, and it updates at the poll interval
  V:
    props is immutable, and state is mutable. if it is immutable, the data is
    set and never changes, but can be altered if it is mutable.
B:
  I:
    when you save the changes in the comments.json file, the data is updated
    2 seconds later, because we used state, and set the poll interval to 2000.
  II:
    It does not render, because it is going to set up a poll interval, which
    will render ever 2 seconds if things have changed.
  III:
    it means that new comments will be added very quickly, and have the newest
    information, you won't submit a comment twice.
  IV:
    optimistic updates are hoping that they can geuss the time that you will
    post something. If the sever rejects the comment, it will be very hard to
    get the comment back. it must simply be retyped.
